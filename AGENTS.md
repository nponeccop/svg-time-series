# AGENTS Instructions

## Guidelines

- Use Node.js 20 or later.
- Keep code formatted with `npm run format`.
- Git pre-commit hooks automatically run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm test`, so you don't need to run these commands separately. Commit your changes and ensure the hooks pass.
- Place new code and tests under appropriate workspaces.
- Use descriptive commit messages.
