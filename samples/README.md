# Samples Workspace

This workspace hosts development demos, experiments, and benchmarks for `svg-time-series`. It is not part of the published library.

## Running demos

From this directory run:

```
npx vite
```

Open the server URL (default: http://localhost:5173) and browse the pages listed in `index.html`. Notable samples include:

- `demos/demo1.html`
- `demos/demo2.html`
- `demos/resetZoom.html`

Additional examples under `misc` and `competitors` are also linked from the index.

## Benchmarks

Scripts in the `benchmarks` folder measure rendering and transformation performance of various chart components. These benchmarks help evaluate and compare different implementation approaches.
